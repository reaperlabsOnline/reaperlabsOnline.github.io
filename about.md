## _"**Slim Reaper** is my name and labbing is my game"_  

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a tinkerer by nature. My journey began with Diablo 2. I used to visit gaming centers in Bakerfield,CA (where I grew up). After a while the money added up. My friend next door had built their own "rig" and, in my opinion, if **HE** could do it then I could. So the begging bagan. My mom is a big supporter of mine and has always been willing to sink large amounts of funds into whatever hobby had piqued my interest (THANK GOD). Otherwise I would have been SOL.  So we set off to the now non-existant **_Compusa_** store to purchase parts for my build. The rest is history. From there I began to tinker with building html and css sites and trying to learn to code. I quickly realized my interests lied more heavily with hardware and networking. Fast forward 15 years later I began building this lab.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really got serious about labbing around 2 years ago. Prior to that I was purely interested in tech from an entertainment standpoint. It was fun to use and allowed me to play games with great graphics and awesome FPS. I am not really sure why but I began to want to learn to be a hacker. Purely for educational research and not with mal-intent. As I began to play with Kali Linux and metasploit, HACKTHEBOX, TRYHACKME, etc. I quickly realized the limitations of my knowledge and began from square one. I picked up some comptia books and perused the inter-web on forums to obsorb as much knowledge as I could. I needed to the know more than just surface level. I wanted to know why something worked and in what order it worked. If I could grasp that then I could understand how to break them. Most of my projects seem to the begin that way.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once I started to get a grasp of networking and servers I purchased my first 1u server and all the required additions **(UPS, Rack, etc)** along with my first fully configurable layer 3 switch. I had a raspberry pi 3b+ already from a previous holiday gift and I was off and running. I loaded proxmox on the 1u server, updated the fireware on the HP Procurve switch, and hosted PI-Hole on the Rasp-Pi and began labbing. To be honest I did not have an exact IT role in mind when I bagan my lab. I took the kitchen sink approach and began learning all that I could. Ultimately I ended up make the 1u server a Windows Server 2019 enviornment with multiple Windows 10 Pro VM's. That was a lot of fun as I had never domain join a PC before nor had I set up a ADDC. It took me 4 tries of wiping and reinstalling before I was ultimately able to get the DC up and runnning and the VM's joining properly.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Due to having a configuable switch I set off to learn as much about network segmentation, access control, logging, and CLI cofiguration that I could. Networking has been the steeepest elarning curve. There are innumerable ways to break a network and sometimes getting back in to fix it can be tricky.
