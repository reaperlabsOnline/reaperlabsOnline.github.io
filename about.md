## **Slim Reaper** is my name and labbing is my game  

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am a tinkerer by nature. My journey began with Diablo 2. I use to visit gaming centers ni Bakerfield,CA (where I grew up). After a while the money added up. My friend next door had built there own "rig" and, in my opiono, if **HE** could do it I could. So the begging bagan. My mom is a big supporter of mine and has always been willnig to sink large amounts of funds into whatever hobby had piqued my interest. So we set off to the now preehistoric **--Compusa--** store to purchase parts for my build. The rest is history. From there I began to tinker withbulding html and css sites and trying to learn to code. I quickly realized my interests lied more heavily with hardware and networking. Fast forward 15 years later I began building this lab.  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really got serious about labbing around 2 years ago. Prior to that I was purely intersted in tech from an entertainment standpoint. It was fun to use and allowed me to play games with great graphics and awesome FPS.
