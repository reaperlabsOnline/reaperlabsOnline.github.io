## "Here we go..."

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  This blog is where I will document my homelab. This is my first ever blog so bear with me as, like my homelab, my blog will be a learning journey as well. I am excited to share this will you and hope that in the course of this blog I can share some valueable knowledge and save you from some of the same mis-steps I made. **(although they did help make me a better admin.)**  The mistakes were many; and the lessons in abundance. I continue to encounter them; as my lab is an ever evolving project. It is nice to meet you and lets take this journey together.
