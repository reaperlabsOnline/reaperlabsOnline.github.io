## welcome to Reaperlabs Blog 

Here is where I will document my homelab. This is my first ever blog so bear with me as, like my homelab, my blog will be learning journey as well. I am excited to share this will you and hope that in the course of this blog I can share some valueable knowledge and save you from some of the same mis-steps I made (although they did help make me a better admin.)
